This is just a learning project, created simply to explore some of the import, exports and control structures of the “Processing” coding language. For full graphics, see https://dataviz.com.au/2018/05/16/animating-keyboard-smudges-a-discovery-project/

Here is the task: 
- Draw a keyboard from co-ordinates data in a CSV file  
- Take input to be typed from a text file  
- Highlight and smudge the key in an animated way by overlaying a semi-random “smudge” shape  
- Display the text as scrolling lines as it is typed – as if replicating a monitor.  
- As letters are typed, make typewriter sounds through the Processing “mimim” library
