As per my project 

A learning project, created simply to explore some of the import, exports and control structures of the “Processing” coding language.
For full graphics, see https://dataviz.com.au/2018/05/16/animating-keyboard-smudges-a-discovery-project/

Here is the task:
Draw a keyboard from co-ordinates data in a CSV file
Take input to be typed from a text file
Highlight and smudge the key in an animated way by overlaying a semi-random “smudge” shape
Display the text as scrolling lines as it is typed – as if replicating a monitor.
As letters are typed, make typewriter sounds through the Processing “mimim” library
